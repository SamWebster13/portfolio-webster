				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This generator creates a scrollable mountain scape with the early sunrise over steep and jagged cliffs, shading them in the early dawn mist. This project was meant to introduce us to the art capabilities of the p5 js library file, and how we can use it to make generative images. </p>
			</div>

			<!-- Technical Section -->
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The scene is built using layers of noise, each part of the screen representing a strip of jagged rectangles, similar to torn paper. The closer the mountains are, the more jagged and darker they appear, creating a sense of depth and distance. They're all drawn in a specific order, as layering is vitaly important in making the image.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Reflection Section -->
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was initially a challenging assignment, and I had to do a lot of research into what I could do with p5. There were some stretch goals I had to abandon for the sake of deadlines, but It did give me a sense of understanding of my capabilities as a coder and is important to create, and what can be done as extra. Below Ill post stretch goals Id want to complete, and strike them through as I finish them:</p>
				<p>- Mist over the mountains</p>
				<p>- Increase the detail level of the mountains</p>
				<p>- have occasional valleys with streams breaking the mountains</p>
				<p>- animate a night time version, with occasionaly shooting stars</p>
			</div>

		});

		// p5.js setup function to create canvas and call the scene rendering function
		function setup() {
			// Create canvas dynamically inside the canvas-container div
			let canvas = createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
			canvas.parent('canvas-container');  // Attach canvas to the container
			reseedScene();  // Call your scene rendering function
		}

		// Example scene generation function
		function reseedScene() {
			background(50, 50, 50);  // Set the background to a dark color
			fill(255, 204, 0);
			noStroke();
			ellipse(width / 2, height / 2, 150, 150);  // Draw a simple shape (e.g., sun)
