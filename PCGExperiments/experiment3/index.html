          This Generator uses a tilesheet to randomly render miniature landscapes, mapping the different kinds of tiles with an ascii table, which can be edited and interacted with in real time.

        <p>
          These landscapes are created through several algorithms, first generating a grid from a seed, and then drawing, placing tiles from the asset sheet into the keyed areas on the grid.

          This assignment was fun, like the others, but by far the most frustrating. I grappled with the website code for hours, days, and to no real evail. I wasted so much time just trying to get basic things to work. Im upset that I wasnt able to finish the entirety of the assingment, but realistically I cant afford anymore time, or mental capacity on this project. The real disapointing part is that I am sure I could have done the dungeon, if I had ever gotten time to try it. Unfortunetly, I was so busy trying to get the website to make two canvas windows for which the dungeon and overworld to sit in, that I just didnt have enough time to test and refine my algorithms for dungeon.
