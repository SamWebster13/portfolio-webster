				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This Experiment was done to try and make a story engine, that would randomly make a basic plot for a story,keeping genre in mind. For example, while each run would be a random roll of genres, subgenres, and characters,</p>
				<p>I made it so that you wouldnt find a wizard in a sci fi western shootout, because while that may be interesting, it'd certainly be hard to write.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Basically I made several groupings based on genres, so each genre, sci fi, fantasy, horror, mystery etc, would have a list of different subgenres, characters, moods, and other descriptors to make story generation more specific.</p>
				<p>When the generator picked a general genre at random, it would be filtered into these lists. If the generator picked the mystery genre, some sub genres would be "Noir", "Supernatural", "Historical", and some characters would be detective, librarian, or reporter, etc.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It had been a while since I had used HTML and javascript in these ways, so It was a slow start, but really my main difficulties was in getting what I made in glitch to work in this website. I had multiple struggles and hurdles with getting formatting</p>
				<p>and other things working the same way it worked in glitch. It was mildly frustrating, but it just reminds me that in the future ill have to think about my code with the formatting of this website in mind, so that the architecture of my code blends well into the architecture of this site.</p>
